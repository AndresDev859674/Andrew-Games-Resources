            <h2>What is Andrew Games</h2>
            <p>It is a Game Launcher with chat and its official games. It also already has an official app.</p>

            <h2>Its Beginning</h2>
            <p>It all started with CMD. To load games, you only needed to use `cd` and `start`. `cd` was for opening the game's folder, and `start` was for opening the game. Updates were only released through the official Discord.</p>
            <p>Then, Andrew Games was made with the best programming language, Python. Even with features to open Andrew Games, a window would pop up saying "Welcome to Andrew Games!" and "Loading...". It was better, but still based on CMD...</p>
            <p>Then came February 2024, and ANDREW GAMES WILL OFFICIALLY BE MADE IN JAVASCRIPT! JavaScript is the second-best programming language (Python is #1). JavaScript is used with Chromium, which means Andrew Games became browser-based! Andrew Games had to use Electron JS. Electron is the best programming platform for creating apps in JavaScript, like the ones made in Electron: Discord, GitHub App, etc. Now, Andrew Games will become the best JavaScript-based launcher!</p>
